## Trump Brand Index data repository

You can find the CSV of just the raw data, or the full Excel spreadsheet here. 

The raw data in the CSV should be self explanatory, but just in case:
* ID. The internal ID of the record
* In Analysis. Whether or not the data was used in calculating the Trump Brand Index
* Date. Date of transaction
* Address. Street Address
* Unit. Condo unit number
* City
* State
* ZIP
* County
* Sale Price. The sale price as reported in the record (see source)
* Sq Ft. Square footage of the unit. Note this was mined from a number of sites. At least two sites need to list the same square footage for it to be validated.
* Price / Sq Ft. Simple math: sale price / sq. ft.
* Trump Property. Is this a Trump property and if so, which one?
* Source. The origin of the sales record.
* Rejection Note. A translation of Factba.se's internal code if the unit was not used in the analysis.
